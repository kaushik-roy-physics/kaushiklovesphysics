- 👋 Hi, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Montreal, Canada. I used to do research in high energy Quantum Chromodynamics during my PhD at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Since then my research interests have moved to the field of Complex Systems. I am particularly interested in using the tools of dynamical systems theory to better understand biological systems. I am currently working on coupled phase oscillators and studying their locally and globally coupled dynamics. From October 2023, I will be joining the Warmflash Lab at Rice University to work on dynamical systems analysis of scRNA-seq data, epigenetic landscapes etc. I am planning to switch from completely theoretical work to a hybrid format that involves doing experiments. I intend to learn some wet lab skills during this coming postdoc. 
- 👀 I’m interested in applying Python for coding in scientific research. I am a theoretical physicist and would like to extend my repertoire with some coding skills. I have been learning Python myself from several resources starting with the book on Computational Physics by Mark Newman. I find it very useful since I know many of the physical concepts beforehand. I intend to refine my skills with more practice and eventually apply them towards Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 using the Udemy Bootcamp. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve dynamical systems theory applications in biological systems. I am also deeply interested in Complex Systems theory, in particular, theorizing the still abstract concepts of emergence. I think that self-organization will shed important light in defining emergence. One of my big hopes is that a theoretical understanding of synchronization in the developmental clock will provide useful insights in this direction. In addtion, I would like to investigate the possibility of applying renormalization group ideas in Complex Systems.
