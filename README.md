- 👋 Hi, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich Germany. I used to do research in high energy Quantum Chromodynamics during my PhD at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Since then my research interests have moved to the field of Complex Systems. I am particularly interested in using the tools of dynamical systems theory to better understand biological systems. For my next postdoctoral appointment which is going to be in the Francois lab at McGill University, I would be working on the geometry of developmental timing. This project will utilize concepts from the theory of synchronization and dynamical systems in general to understand how the oscillators (genetic feedback loops) in individual cells synchronize with each other to produce a well-defined time period of embryonic segmentation. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python for coding in scientific research. I am a theoretical physicist and would like to extend my repertoire with some coding skills. I have been learning Python myself from several resources starting with the book on Computational Physics by Mark Newman. I find it very useful since I know many of the physical concepts beforehand. I intend to refine my skills with more practice and eventually apply them towards Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 using the Udemy Bootcamp. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve dynamical systems theory applications in biological systems. I am also deeply interested in Complex Systems theory, in particular, theorizing the still abstract concepts of emergence. I think that self-organization will shed important light in defining emergence. One of my big hopes is that a theoretical understanding of synchronization in the developmental clock will provide useful insights in this direction. In addtion, I would like to investigate the possibility of applying renormalization group ideas in Complex Systems.
