- 👋 Hi, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python for coding in scientific research. I am a theoretical physicist and would like to extend my repertoire with some coding skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3 using the Udemy Bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on theoretical physics projects involving gravity and non-perturbative QCD.
- 📫 You can reach me at kauroy@mpp.mpg.de
